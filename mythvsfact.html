For diagnostic tests, as you take a blood vial. It's just a tiny sting, however the needle stays in the arm for longer. If you can withstand regular needles you can handle a donation of blood.<br>

Heavy weights immediately after blood donation, the body bounces back afterwards relatively quick.<br>

	                            If you are well, within a day or two you'll be completely regenerated. Take it easy on your donation day and drink plenty of water to keep hydrated.<br>

                        <h3><span>Fact : </span>If you don't have any other severe complications from diabetes like skin, blood flow or kidney issues and if you regulate your insulin levels with a balanced diet and lifestyle, there's no reason that you can't donate blood. The SANBS mark diabetics "well" as long as they regulate their diabetes.<br>

                           However, you would not be eligible to donate if you use insulin made from bovine secretion due to the threat of Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (a type of "mad cow" disease). But not all conventional insulin would stop you from donating blood.</h3>

The rational argument may be that because of their reproductive structure women have smaller haemoglobin levels than men. Women live in lower amounts of haemoglobin, usually. So giving blood impacts them the same way a man will be affected by it. Therefore, whether women are breastfeeding, lactating, anaemic, or recovering from a medical condition that reduces the amount of haemoglobin, they should give blood.</h3>

As long as you make sure you 're drinking enough water and juices to top up your body fluids. Alcohol, and direct sunshine can also be avoided for 24 hours. Still donating blood doesn't provide you with a reason to bunk your daily duties!</h3>
