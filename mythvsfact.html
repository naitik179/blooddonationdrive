                            cannot be donated. </h2>
                        <h3><span>Fact :</span>Vegetarians can donate blood. The iron needed is taken from body stores
                            and once a balanced diet is maintained is replaced after donation. This usually normally
                            takes a month or so.</h3>

                        <h3><span>Fact : </span>The needle used for blood donations is the same size of the needle used
                            when you draw a vial of blood for medical tests. It’s only a small prick, even though the
                            needle remains in your arm for longer. If you can tolerate normal injections, you will be
                            able to handle a blood donation.<br>

                            There might be slight soreness and a bit of bruising at the area, but this should not last
                            long.</h3>

                            heavy weights directly after donating blood, your body does bounce back fairly quickly
                            afterwards.<br>

                            If you are healthy, you will be fully regenerated after a day or two. Take it easy on the
                            day of your donation and drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.<br>

                            blood vessel or kidney problems and if you control your insulin levels through a healthy
                            diet and lifestyle, there is no reason why you can’t donate blood. The SANBS consider
                            diabetics "healthy" as long as their diabetes is controlled.<br>

                            However, if you use insulin made from bovine secretion, you will not be eligible to donate
                            due to concerns about Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease (a variation of “mad cow” disease). But not
                            all modern insulin will prohibit you from donating blood.</h3>

                            well donate blood. This frame might be considered high, but it does not isolate you from
                            donating blood. Moreover, blood pressure medicines do not interfere with the process at all.

                            anything to do with gender? That women bleed every month anyway, so they shouldn't? The
                            logical argument could be that women have a lower haemoglobin count than men due to their
                            biological setup. Women naturally survive in lower haemoglobin levels. So, blood donation
                            affects them the same way that it would affect a man. Thus, unless women are pregnant,
                            lactating, anaemic, or suffering from some medical issue that lowers haemoglobin count --
                            they can donate blood.</h3>

                            long as you make sure you drink enough water and juices to replenish your body fluids. You
                            should also avoid alcohol and direct sunlight for 24 hours. But, donating blood doesn't give
                            you enough of an excuse to bunk your daily chores!</h3>
